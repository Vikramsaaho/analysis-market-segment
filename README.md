analyzing the transaction data to identify the top 3 most profitable products and determine the characteristics of the most loyal customers. Then, I'll summarize my findings. Let me first inspect the data.

The datasets contain the following key information:

Transaction Data (transaction_data):

Contains purchase details, including product number, product name, quantity purchased, total sales, and store information.
LYLTY_CARD_NBR represents a unique customer identifier.
TOT_SALES represents the total amount spent on a transaction.
Customer Purchase Behavior (purchase_behaviour_data):

Maps each customer (LYLTY_CARD_NBR) to a Lifestage (e.g., "Young Singles/Couples", "Older Families") and Premium Customer Segment (e.g., "Premium", "Budget", "Mainstream").
Next Steps
Identify the top 3 most profitable products based on total revenue.
Analyze loyal customers by identifying the most frequent shoppers and their demographic characteristics.
Provide insights into why these loyal customers prefer certain products based on purchasing patterns.
Now, I will proceed with the analysis. ​​

Findings:
Top 3 Most Profitable Products:

Dorito Corn Chips Supreme 380g ($40,352 total sales)
Smiths Crinkle Chip Original Big Bag 380g ($36,367.6 total sales)
Smiths Crinkle Chips Salt & Vinegar 330g ($34,804.2 total sales)
Most Loyal Customer Segment:

Older Families (Budget Buyers) are the most frequent shoppers, with a total of 23,160 purchases.
Hypothesis on Loyal Customer Behavior:
Budget-conscious older families likely prioritize value for money, preferring larger pack sizes (e.g., 330g–380g chips).
They may buy snacks in bulk for family consumption or social gatherings.
Their preference for familiar brands like Doritos and Smiths suggests brand loyalty and trust in classic flavors.
